<h2 class="section-heading">Workshop (30th July and 1st August)</h2>

<p>The workshops were organized around presentations of how application of data science methods are applied to problems relevant to Africa and last year in particular saw more presentations around agricultural solutions among other topics in the areas including: healthcare, social media, geospatial modelling, economic monitoring, resume writing, Internet Of Things and data science for the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

<p>A panel discussion on Data Science Africa Uganda Network  was conducted. The panel discussion consisted of a dialogue on the benefits of growing local data science chapters that would duplicate the activities of data science to students, researchers and professionals at a local level (by region and districts) in Uganda. </p>

<p>Some of the achievements that DSA  has attained with the Labs collaboration since 2015 include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Organised week long events in six African countries including Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria and Ethiopia. End of this year these countries will have increased to eight with South Africa and Senegal.</li>
    <li>DSA has given out research grants each worth 10,000USD to 10 research teams across Africa, after a competitive application process with more 121 applications</li>
    <li>Attracted high level data science expertise from academia, private sector, civil society, governments, UN and NGO to instruct in summer schools and showcase their work in workshops - at their own cost travel and accommodation.</li>
    <li>DSA has received participation from 28 African countries, these countries are shared in Figure 1. </li>
</ul>

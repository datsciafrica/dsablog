<p>Data Science Africa (DSA) has built a strong foundation of data literacy through its various programs and training events and continues to nurture a community of African data scientists. At a recent event in Kigali, the community sought to take the impact of DSA to another level by exploring the potential of research and projects to support effective data-driven policy-making in Africa.
<br>
<br>
I was interested in this, having experienced firsthand the need to link data science with decision-making while working as a data analyst at UN Global Pulse Kampala. Last year, I worked with DSA to curate a series of talks, one-on-one conversations, and open discussions during DSA events, all of which proved very enlightening. The aim was to empower participants to think beyond developing data-centric solutions and consider how data science might affect policy-making.</p>


<p>At the Kigali event, the highlight was an open discussion in which we examined challenges, explored our role as data scientists, and spotted opportunities for research on how data science can support policy.  
In a room full of data-driven solution developers, with only a handful of decision-makers, participants had a lively discussion that showed diverse perspectives. Yet a notable consensus was evident – a shared recognition of the role data scientists can play.

<p>Participants were asked what challenges they had experienced in translating data science solutions into pointers for practical policy. 
“It’s challenging to explain the data science solutions to policymakers,” said one. 
“The needs of decision-makers are ever-changing, making it hard to find or generate relevant and timely evidence,” said another. 
A third noted: “There are many other things that influence policy, e.g., politics, which hinder data use.”
